# Dermatologic Image Analysis on Skin Lesions: Benign and Malignant

## Introduction
Skin lesion is an abnormal skin tissue which is different to the surrounding skin. It can be classified into three types which are benign, premalignant and malignant. Benign is a harmless skin lesion while malignant is generally considered as a cancer. Premalignant means it can potentially develop to malignant. They can be caused by various reasons such as damage, underlying disorders or genetic disorders [1, 2]. As the physical differences of skin lesions can be observed, visual examination would be conducted to diagnose skin conditions along with medical history. Currently, diagnosis of malignant skin lesions relies on a qualitative visual examination which may reduce reliability and reproducibility of diagnosis [3]. Therefore, using the physical difference, it is possible to make an improvement on the diagnosis of dermatology patients. In this analysis, quantitative differences in terms of image analysis were produced to compare between benign and malignant.

## Data
A dataset of images depicting skin lesions was used in this project. The images are a subset of the data from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) Challenge 2016. The following paper describes the 2016 challenge:
